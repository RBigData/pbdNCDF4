Description: This package adds collective parallel read and write capability
    to the R package ncdf4 version 1.8. Typical use is as a
    parallel NetCDF4 file reader in SPMD style programming. Each R
    process reads and writes its own data in a synchronized
    collective mode, resulting in faster parallel performance.
    Performance improvement is conditional on a parallel file system.
SystemRequirements: OpenMPI (>= 1.5.4) on Solaris, Linux and Mac. (Parallel)
    HDF5 and (Parallel) NetCDF4 (4.1 or later) libraries. No MPI library
    required on Windows.
